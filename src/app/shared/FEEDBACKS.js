        description: 'This is a great bag, it is a perfect size and very sturdy. It is woven beautifully and holds a great number of items. I put a large water bottle and other items in this bag to where it gets quite heavy and there have been no signs of stretching or tearing. I definitely recommend this bag!'

        description: 'I have been using it nonstop since I got it. I love that it\'s a little more on the smaller side as I am trying to get use to carrying less items in my bags. It fits all the necessities! Phone, keys, wallet, AirPods, chapstick and hand sanitizer/lotion. I\'ve also managed to carry my iPad with me on a few occasions and a make bag. So it definitely will carry what you need! It seems pretty sturdy and I think it will last me a while, which I hope because I really like this bag!'

        description: 'This bag seems to be very nice. It was light weight and appeared to be very well constructed. The material/knit it is made of gave me a "fall/winter" vibe, not what I was looking for, so I returned it and therefore, cannot speak to how well it may hold up with use.'
